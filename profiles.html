				<p>Better known as Joseph Stalin, or Big Joe, he is the face of the league and a menace to society on and off the court. 
				His solid, all-around play leaves little to be desired, and he always seems to find a way to top the charts. He set the record for most 
				points with 478 in a stellar 2013 season. He is also a great dunker, in past years often contesting the title of Chief of Dunks. Despite racking up
				the points year after year, he still manages to injure his opponents along with the best of them, showing true savagery in his mauling.</p>
